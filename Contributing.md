### How can you help?

**Join our efforts on GitHub!**

We are looking for help to improve the user interface,
improve the user experience,
improve the responsivity by accelerating image rendering,
allow operation in different devices (different Web browsers, iOS, Android),
testing with different nifti files,
add the ability to open files from a URL,
improving the documentation, creating tutorials. We are also open
to hearing your ideas for improvement
and extension of Thresholdmann.

You can check out if there is an open [issue](https://github.com/neuroanatomy/thresholdmann/issues) you'd like to jump on, and get in touch with us there.  
You can also open a new issue to let us know about bugs, or request a new feature.

We will be happy to work with anyone who would love to join our effort.  

**Test new functionalities**  

If you would like to change the code, please make sure the existing tests run using ```npm install && npm run test```.  
If you add a new functionality, please also implement new test(s) to make sure of its correct working. Thank you.
